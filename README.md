## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Greetings! I'm Eduard and you can call me Ed.

I'm a recent convert to the exciting world of DevOps!  Having a background used linux and knowlege in C, I'm fascinated by the potential of DevOps to bridge the gap between development and deployments, leading to smoother workflows and faster run progeckt.

Currently ðŸŒ±, I'm actively learning about core DevOps concepts like:

* Version Control Systems (VCS): Grasping the power of tools like Git for efficient code management and collaboration.

* Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Understanding how to automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline for faster releases with fewer errors.

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Exploring tools like Terraform or Ansible to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration for consistency and repeatability.


ðŸ”­ Continuous Learning is Key!

The DevOps landscape is constantly evolving, and I'm dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest tools and methodologies.  Currently, I'm digging deeper into containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to explore their role in modern application deployment.

Let's collaborate and streamline the software development lifecycle!
