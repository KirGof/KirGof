## Hi there 👋

Greetings! I'm Eduard (call me Ed), a DevOps engineer with 2+ years of hands-on commercial experience optimizing deployments and infrastructure.

With a solid Linux foundation, I've bridged dev and ops teams to deliver reliable, scalable systems. Here's what I've been building:

    Custom Helm charts for streamlined Kubernetes deployments.

    CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins, including tailored solutions for business-specific challenges.

    Kubernetes manifests and Istio configurations for robust microservices orchestration.

    Vault integration with automated SSL certificate generation for secure secrets management.

    Nginx configurations optimized for high-traffic environments.

    Log analysis and troubleshooting to pinpoint and resolve production issues swiftly.
